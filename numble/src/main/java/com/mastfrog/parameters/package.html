        <h1>Parameters API</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                This is a little library for managing parameters which come in the
                form of an untyped map object, and turning them into typed objects
                without hand-writing a lot of validation code.
            </p>
            <p>
                It does two things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Generates a Java class from the parameters you list, via an
                    annotation processor, so you have type-safe access to your parameters</li>
                <li>Provides a utility for validating the parameters before you
                    instantiate one of those
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Using this library comes in a few steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write a wrapper for <code><a href="KeysValues.html">KeysValues</a></code> that exposes the
                    data you want to use at runtime.  Essentially it's a <code>Map&lt;String,String&gt;</code>
                    minus the mutators.
                <li>Annotate a type with &#064;Params</li>
                <li>Declare some parameters as its value, with &#064;Param
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each param has a type</li>
                        <li>Each param has a list of validators from the built-in
                            <code>StringValidators</code> enum from the
                            <a href="https://kenai.com/projects/simplevalidation">Simple Validation project></a>
                        </li>
                        <li>You can declare additional validators by type
                            <ul>
                                <li>These will be instantiated with Guice, so they can take
                                    any injectable object in a constructor annotated with
                                    &#064;Inject</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
